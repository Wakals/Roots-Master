# Roots-Master
###### A light program to help recite the root word implemented by Python. 

## Introduction

Reciting these roots is a requirement of PKU's B-level English course "English Vocabulary and English-American Culture". Although there are already some programs to assist me in reciting roots, they are not customized enough for me. Therefore, in order to deepen memory and have a more suitable experience for me, this warehouse is also used as an auxiliary program to recite roots.

## Dependency

pip install tkinter
